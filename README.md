# Course Project Getting and Cleaning Data

In this repository you will find the source code and the codebook.

There are comments within the source code that describe what I was doing. Particularly I first labelled the variables and later took the means and stds as I thought it would make more sense like that.

The CodeBook contains an overiew over the the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I performed.
